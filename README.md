# Customer Churn Prediction Analysis Using Machine Learning
## Project Objective
The data set belongs to a leading online E-Commerce company. An online retail (E commerce) company wants to know the customers who are going to churn.

## Dataset used
<a href=https://github.com/Poojitha2509/Customer-Churn-Prediction-Analysis/blob/main/E%20Commerce%20Dataset.xlsx>E-Commerce Dataset</a>

## Process
- Downloaded The Dataset From Kaggle Website.
- Imported the dataset.
- Performed EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Trained and Tested the dataset with 3 Algorithms(Decision Tree, Random Forest and XG Boost)

## Conclusion
Knowing customer behaviour can greatly enhance decision-making processes and can further help reduce churn to improve profitability.
I used machine learning to predict customer churn and found it to be highly effective. By predicting churn, can reduce customer loss and improve business. XG Boost beat Decision Tree and Random Forest with its high accuracy.
